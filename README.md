Photo Selection Tools v.0.1
=====================

This library was created as an alternative to UIImagePickerController. There are some limitations with that. Specifically, you can't use it in an existing UINavigationController in a UIPopoverController on the iPad. So I had to roll my own. 

_This is a bit of a work in progress._ It has not been thoroughly tested or used in a production environment yet. If you find any issues or problems, please file a github issue or make a pull request and I'll deal with it promptly.

Integration
-----------
First, this requires a deployment target of iOS 6.0 or greater. If your app still targets iOS 5, I'm sorry. You need a better product or project manager. People who still have iOS 5 on their phone don't deserve nice things. 

Apple has far better instructions on integrating a static library [here]
(http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#technotes/iOSStaticLibraries/Articles/configuration.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012554-CH3-SW1).

You will also probably need to link against the AssetsLibrary.framework as well. 
Usage
-----
There are three core classes, and they are some what documented in the code. Pretty much everything can be subclassed, and the view controllers can have their default cells set for custom UI. The default UI is very bare-bones.


**MDSAssetsController** This can be used to interact with the ALAssetsLibrary. If you're just creating a basic picker then you probably won't need it, as it will just be used by the other classes.

**MDSAlbumsViewController** This view controller feeds up a table view which allows the user to select a ALAssetsGroup, in other words a photo album. There is no behavior when the user selects a group, other than calling the view controller's delegate. You are responsible for doing something, such as pushing the photo selector on screen. 

**MDSPhotoSelectViewController** This feeds up a UICollectionView which allows the user to select a photo / asset in the provided ALAssetsGroup. The default selection behavior does nothing other than call back to the delegate. You are responsible for handling any subsequent behavior, i.e. popping views off a UINavigationController.
